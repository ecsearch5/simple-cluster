{"name":"Simple-k-means","tagline":"A simple implementation for clustering methods such as k-means, EM algorithm, ...","body":"Simple Clusters\r\n===============================\r\n\r\n## What is this?\r\n\r\nThis is a simple implementation of the state-of-the-art clustering methods such as k-means, EM algorithm, ... \r\nThe implementations based on many papers that are mentioned below. This project is under GNU GPL v3 License. Just read the license statement.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project is to provide a more flexible interface for clustering methods. In OpenCV, the implementations of k-means algorithm is limited. Thus, I hope to this one will prodive an implementation with more choices for k-means. Sometimes, reducing the distortion is more important than improving the runtime performance. Other clustering methods will also be considered and be implemented. The input of many methods now are vectors, I hope to improve this issue soon, i.e let you input files.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* An Unix or Windows([Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) not native Windows with an MSVC compiler) Operating System. Tested on Mac OS X 10.9 and Ubuntu 14.04.\r\n* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) 2.8 or newer. For UNIX users, check your CMake version in terminal by `cmake -version`.\r\n* An C++ compiler that supports C++ 11.\r\n* [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/downloads.html) 2.4.8 or newer. This library is used for testing only. Just for comparing the performance with our implementations.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n* To build this project, just type:\r\n```bash\r\n$ cmake -H. -B<where_you_want_to_save_CMake_build_files>\r\n### Example\r\n$ cmake -H. -Bbuild\r\n```\r\non your terminal. This will generate CMake files under `build/` and binaries under `bin/`. Then type:\r\n```bash\r\n$ cmake --build <the_location_of_CMake_build_files> -- -j3\r\n```\r\nto generate the binaries.\r\n\r\n* The above step would generate in `bin/` folder the following files: `libsimplecluster.*`,`test_*`. \r\n* The `test_*` are unit test programs. You can review the source of unit tests in `test/`. They are also self-explained documentation for the common usage.\r\n* An example to show you how to use this library: https://github.com/marker68/example-simplecluster\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nI welcome any contributions. First, read some materials like [How to contribute to an open source project?](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) or [an excellent example from FuelPHP](https://github.com/fuelphp/fuelphp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). I will work on this term later.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nThis project uses Doxygen to generate its documentation.
