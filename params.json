This project is under GNU GPL v3 License. Just read the license statement.\r\nIf you need any other licenses, feel free to contact me at [t_nguyen@hal.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp](mailto:t_nguyen@hal.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp)\r\nThe purpose of this project is to provide a more flexible interface for clustering methods.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Supported k-means algorithm.\r\n* Supported [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/).\r\n* Supported only L2 metric distance.\r\n* Supported KD-tree with ANN search.\r\n* Supported GNU C++ Compiler and clang compiler.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* An Unix or Windows([Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) not native Windows with an MSVC compiler) Operating System. Tested on Mac OS X 10.9 and Ubuntu 14.04.\r\n* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) 2.8 or newer. For UNIX users, check your CMake version in terminal by `cmake -version`.\r\n* An GNU C++ Compiler or clang compiler that support C++ 11.\r\n* [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/downloads.html) 2.4.8 or newer. This library is used for testing only. Just for comparing the performance with our implementations.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\nWe use CMake as the build system. On terminal,\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:marker68/simple-k-means.git simple-cluster\r\n$ cd ./simple-cluster\r\n$ cmake -H. -Bbuild && cmake --build build -- -j3\r\n```\r\nThis script will create the following files in your `bin/` directory.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ls  bin\r\nCMakeFiles  libgtest_main.a      test_kdtree  test_utilities\r\nlibgtest.a  libsimplecluster.so  test_kmeans\r\n```\r\n* `libgtest_main.a,libgtest.a`: [Google Testing Framework](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/)'s static library files. We are using Google Test for testing.\r\n* `libsimplecluster.{so,dylib,dll}`: dynamic library(shared library) files for SimpleCluster.\r\n* `test_utilities, test_kdtree, test_kmeans`: test programs. See their source code in `test/` directory to know the basics of this library.\r\n\r\n## Samples\r\n\r\nSamples for the usage of this library could be found at: https://github.com/marker68/example-simplecluster\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nThis project uses Doxygen to generate its documentation. You cand find it in `doc/` or an online version at http://simplecluster.tech-codes.com/\r\n\r\n## Change log\r\n\r\n* **At version 1.0(2014/10/05)**:\r\n    * Supported k-means algorithm.\r\n    * Supported [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/).\r\n    * Supported only L2 metric distance.\r\n    * Supported KD-tree with ANN search.\r\n    * Supported GNU C++ Compiler and clang compiler.\r\n    \r\n## References\r\n\r\n[1] S.
